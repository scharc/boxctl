# Agent Context

You are running in an boxctl containerized environment.

## Understanding boxctl: Inside vs Outside

**You are INSIDE the container right now.** boxctl has two parts:

### INSIDE (Where You Are)
- **Location:** Docker container
- **Working directory:** `/workspace` (your project code)
- **What you CAN do:**
  - Edit files in `/workspace`
  - Run `agentctl worktree` - manage git worktrees for parallel branch work
  - Use all dev tools: git, node, python, docker CLI, etc.
  - Desktop notifications are automatic (Claude via hooks, others via stall detection)

**What you CANNOT do:**
- Run `abox` or `boxctl` commands (those are host-only)
- Manage containers or add MCP servers (requires host rebuild)
- Access host filesystem outside mounted volumes

### OUTSIDE (Host System)
The user's laptop that controls containers:
- `abox` - Quick launcher for agents
- `boxctl` - Container lifecycle, MCP servers, workspace management
- Web proxy service - Notification bridge

## Environment
- **Working directory:** `/workspace` (your project root)
- **Container:** Isolated Docker environment with full development tooling
- **Shell:** Bash (default)

## Workflow Best Practices
- Commit changes frequently using git
- Keep a development log in `.boxctl/LOG.md`
- After completing tasks, update the project-specific notes below to help future agents
- **No AI attribution:** Never add "Written by Claude", "Generated by AI", "Co-Authored-By: Claude" or similar notes to commits, code, or documentation

## Available Resources
Dynamic context about workspace mounts, MCP servers, and skills will be provided at runtime.
